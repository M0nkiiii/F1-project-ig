					F1 pre-season testing can often throw up more questions than it answers. So, after six days of running at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, we’ve picked out the five hottest topics doing the rounds at this year's winter tests, and tried to make some sense of it all ahead of the season-opener in Australia.
				</p>
				<h2>What's the story?</h2>
				<p style="font-weight: 520">
					The onboard cameras fitted to the Mercedes W11 on Thursday morning of Week 1 picked up some weird activity going on in the cockpit, as Lewis Hamilton yanked and pushed on his steering wheel to alter the toe angle of the front wheels – with speculation that the DAS, or Dual Axis Steering system (as it’s known), would help reduce front tyre cooling on the straights, particularly useful at tracks like Sochi, Yas Marina and Baku.
				</p>
				<h2>What are people saying?</h2>
					Rivals’ jaws hit the floor when the system was spotted, with Renault’s Daniel Ricciardo a particular fan. “I loved seeing that. Hats off to them because they have been dominant this whole turbo era yet they are still the ones pushing everyone else,” he said graciously – before adding with a twinge of jealousy: “It should be us and everyone else pushing them.”
				<br>
				<h2>How will this play out?</h2>
					Mystery still surrounds DAS. But early impressions seem to suggest that it’s a game-helper, rather than a gamechanger, as Mercedes – with the luxury of vast resources, a lateral-thinking technical department and already the best car anyway – simply refine the current formula further and hoover up those marginal gains. The team’s brilliance in bringing the system to the track could be a useful bargaining chip in their contract negotiations with Lewis Hamilton this year, though…
				<br>
				<h1>2. Where are Ferrari?</h1>

				<h2>What’s the story?</h2>
					Having blitzed 2019 pre-season only to take “a real slap” (Charles Leclerc’s words) at the first race in Australia, Ferrari played it very low key at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in 2020. Our data analysis from testing put them a second off Mercedes (and behind McLaren, Renault and Haas) on long-run pace, while on short-run pace, they were 1.7s back, plus a full half a second off Mercedes on the straights – though they did look to have made gains in cornering speeds. Hmm.
				<br>
				<h2>What are people saying?</h2>
					Were Ferrari sandbagging during testing this year? “No doubt, no,” was Team Principal Mattia Binotto’s no-frills response. But that was at odds with Leclerc’s reply when asked if testing had been a disaster for Ferrari, as the data appeared to suggest. “Definitely not,” laughed Leclerc. “I'm pretty sure the top three teams haven't shown their true potential.” So the picture is foggy – and as Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner said, “I think it would be foolish to underestimate [Ferrari] going into Melbourne”.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h1>3. Are Red Bull the team Mercedes should fear most in 2020?</h1>

					<h2>What’s the story?</h2>
					Red Bull’s performance in 2019 was on such an upwards trajectory that many suggested the four-time champs were well-placed to rediscover title glory in 2020, with the regulations having remained largely stable. That was seemingly backed up by pre-season testing, with Max Verstappen finishing just 0.073s behind Bottas on the final day in the innovative RB16, despite setting his fastest time on the C4 tyre, compared to Bottas’ lap on the softest C5.
					<br>
					<h2>What are people saying?</h2>
					The team appear confident, with Horner revealing his belief that Red Bull had “the strength and depth in our team to hopefully put a real challenge together this year”. F1 tech guru Mark Hughes appeared to agree, writing on F1.com that the RB16 “looks fantastically agile in the medium-high speed sequences, notably between Turns 2-3. The abruptness with which Max Verstappen and Alex Albon could change direction there shaded even the Mercedes.”
					<br>
					<h2>How will this play out?</h2>
					Red Bull look like dark horses for this year’s constructors’ title, no doubt. Problem is, they’ve been 'dark horses' ever since they were dethroned by Mercedes in 2014. Can they really step up this year and claim a title – drivers’ or constructors’ – for the first time since 2013?
					<br>
					The constructors’ is a question mark, with Verstappen and Albon the least-proven of the top-three teams' line-ups. But both car and Honda power unit look strong, and there seems little doubt that Verstappen is now capable of stringing a championship bid together with the right tool. Should they have the decent start to their campaign that Verstappen has been banging the drum for in recent weeks, they could well get the job done.
